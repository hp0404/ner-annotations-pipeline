Peterson of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst offers a more useful analytical tool in her book, Recognition of Governments, in which she identifies "main" and "other criteria" that states have used in determining whether to recognize a governmentShe lists as the "main criteria" playing a role in such a decision: the ability to elicit popular support from the population; whether the government assumed or retained power legitimately, i.e., whether it occurred pursuant to a constitutional process rather than by force; whether the government has the ability and will to fulfill its country's international obligations, that is, whether the government will uphold prior obligations entered into by its predecessors;142 As "other" criteria playing a role in the decision-making process, Professor Peterson examines: whether the government could survive in the absence of the active military support of another state, ensuring that it is not a puppet state; the state's willingness to honor other states' rights by observing international law; the manner in which the government seized power, namely whether it used undue violence; whether the government's origins conform with international law;143 and the government's willingness to respect the human rights of its citizens by abiding by international human rights standards Thus, according to the above criteria, a government is entitled to recognition if: it enjoys active or passive popular support and governs in accordance with the rule of law domestically, i.e. criteria i, ii, iv, vi, and viii; and it does not threaten the interests of the international community, i.e. criteria iii, v, and vii.
